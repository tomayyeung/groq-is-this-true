  - automatically scans the site when you open it without us clicking the button
  - only alerts when there's misinformation
  - pro plan?
- website bias checker
  - there are some tools out there that can tell you how biased a website is / what their media bias is
  - https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart
  - can try to find an api? if not, just hard code some shit
  - cache results?
- edit dom
  - when we find misinformation in the text, highlight it in red
